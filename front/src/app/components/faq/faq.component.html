        <div class="faq-question">What is a password manager?</div>
        <p>A password manager is a software application designed to store and manage online credentials. It securely
            stores your passwords and helps you log into your online accounts automatically.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">How does the password manager keep my data secure?</div>
        <p>Our password manager uses advanced encryption algorithms to secure your data. Your Master Password is the key
            to decrypting your data, ensuring that only you can access your sensitive information.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">What should I do if I forget my Master Password?</div>
        <p>If you forget your Master Password, unfortunately, there is no way to recover it. This is because your data
            is encrypted with your Master Password, and without it, the data cannot be decrypted. It's crucial to
            remember your Master Password or store it in a safe place.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Why does the application ask me to re-enter my master password when I refresh the
            page?</div>
        <p>For security reasons, your Master Password is only stored temporarily in your browser's memory. When you
            refresh the page, this memory is cleared, so you need to enter your Master Password again to access your
            data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">Is it safe to store all my passwords in one place?</div>
        <p>Yes, it is safe to store all your passwords in one place with a password manager. Password managers are
            designed with security as a top priority, using strong encryption to protect your data from unauthorized
            access.</p>
