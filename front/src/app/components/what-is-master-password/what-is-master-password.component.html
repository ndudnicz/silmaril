    <h1>What is a Master Password?</h1>
    <p>
        A <strong>Master Password</strong> is a primary password that you use to protect access to all your sensitive data. In the context of our password management application, the Master Password is used to encrypt and decrypt your personal information.
    </p>
    <div class="highlighted highlight-blue">
        <p>
            Without your Master Password, no one can access your data, not even us. This means you are the only one who can decrypt and view your passwords and sensitive information.
        </p>

    <h2>Why is a Master Password important?</h2>
    <p>
        The Master Password adds an extra layer of security. Even if someone gains access to your account, they cannot see your passwords without the Master Password.
